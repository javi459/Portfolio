<!--     about me and passion for web dev. -->
    <p>As technology has been evolving through out the years, my interest in what goes behind the "screens" has grown. One night after researching for several nights about web developement I decided to self educate myself with free resources online. Resources like Google, freecodecamp.org, YouTube and many others. My passion quickly began to grow for coding so I decided to become a student at Thinkful</p> 
    
    <p>As a student at Thinkful I have been provided the opportunity to work with other developers and make great connections.</p>

    <p>When I'm away from my computer my interests include:</p>
    <ul class="center">
      <li>Spending time with my beautiful wife and daughter</li>
      <li>Listening to music</li>
      <li>Exploring new things</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="center">Looking to hire a devolper whose passionate about what he does or even just a partner to work on a project with? Please reach out! I would be eager to work with other developers to help each other grow by doing what we enjoy!</p>
